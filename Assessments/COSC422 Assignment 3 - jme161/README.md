# COSC422 Assessment 3

Computer Graphics (2021);  University of Canterbury

## DESCRIPTION
* Enhance the animated display generated by *SkeletonAnimation.cpp* by designing a surrounding environment comprising of 
  simple graphics objects for the model, and also replace the skeletal model generated by 
  Assimp with a more “humanoid-like” or “robot-like” model. 
* The graphics environment allows the model to interact with a few objects in the scene during an animation sequence.
* Improvement from Assessment I scene of COSC-363
* Implemented in C++ with OpenGL 2
